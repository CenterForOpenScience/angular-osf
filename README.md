## Testing the project

The project uses jest for unit testing.
A "counter" script executes before and after each test run to track how many times the unit
tests are run locally. The output is displayed.

```bash
npm run test (single test run)
npm run test:watch (single run after file save)
npm run test:coverage (code coverage results)
```

- all commits must pass the local pipeline for test coverage

```bash
npm run test:check-coverage-thresholds
```

- Verifies newly added tests match the thresholds
- This is only used until we hit 100% test coverage
- all commits must pass the local pipeline for test coverage

## Volta

OSF uses volta to manage node and npm versions inside of the repository
Install Volta from [volta](https://volta.sh/) and it will automatically pin Node/npm per the repo toolchain.
